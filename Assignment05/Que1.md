##### **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) using Agile Methodology**

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**





###### **1. Abstract**

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a strategic software solution designed to manage customer interactions, streamline sales, and enhance service delivery. This project report presents the development of a CRM system using Agile methodology, which emphasizes iterative progress, stakeholder collaboration, and adaptability. The system manages customer data, sales pipelines, and support requests while ensuring continuous improvement through regular feedback cycles. Agile ensures faster delivery, flexibility, and scalability of the CRM solution.



###### **2. Introduction**

CRM systems are critical for modern businesses to maintain strong customer relationships and improve operational efficiency. Traditional systems often fail to adapt to dynamic customer needs. Agile methodology provides a flexible framework for developing CRM solutions that evolve with business requirements.
